This is a GUI applicaton that simulates a Fraction calculator. 
This app will ask the user to enter integer values for a numerator and denominator of a fraction. 
It will then present a range of options for the user to perform operations on the fraction, such as displaying it as a decimal, showing its reciprocal value, or reducing it to its lowest terms. 
As well, it will allow the user to enter a second fraction and then do arithmetic operations on them, such as adding them or
multiplying them together
